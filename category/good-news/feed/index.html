<p>There&#8217;s more research showing how the heart and mind are connecting in wellness. There&#8217;s much an opposition to once was thought as it&#8217;s all in &#8220;your head&#8221;. On my search and journey for answers on mind-body connection I am finding research on how valuable art, writing and deep breathing is on a persons overall well being. It doesn&#8217;t take much to start: simply grab a pen and paper and some space to reflect and let yourself draw, write a few things to be thankful.. Take a few deep breaths!</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the steps I used in creating a new motivational map: </strong></p>
<p>1) How motivated are you?</p>
<p>2) Do you have a motivational mindset or do you give up easily?</p>
<p>3) Practice daily scanning your thoughts for any negativity. Write down even the subtle thoughts which creep up. </p>
<p>4) Reframe those negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Engineer a positive feedback. </p>
<p>5) Be a watcher of those thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p>6) Make a decision to choose your thoughts and make a decision for thoughts you don’t like by using your mind to choose not to aim for those thoughts. </p>
<p>7) Brainstorm- Map out all of your thoughts into bubbles and draw out links or associations.</p>
<p>8) Reflect on your brainstorming session.</p>
<p>9) Revise any changes you want to make in your thinking. </p>
<p>10) Practice more of the hobbies or activities which make you happy. </p>
<p>11) Know your why? Why do you think or act a certain way? What is the underlining reasons below your goals?</p>
<p>12) Some people are motivated by the ego, but instead opt for what you want your legacy to be. </p>
<p>13) Try a new activity which may push you past your comfort zone. This activity must be safe. An example, is be daring to try your dream at living in Greece for a year. Whatever it may be.. be bold. </p>
<p>14) Find people which replicate parts of your ideal goal. Research what they are doing and compare the actions. Make sure to never compare yourself to others… this is different than just thinking about the tasks taken.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat these steps over the course of 30 days. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a snapshot at 6 Habits to Happiness:</strong></p>
<p>1) Be present, be in the moment and stay focused: what this means is not allowing thoughts of the past or future get in the way of the present moment. Gear your mind to only have focus on being in the moment whether it is on a task or spending quality time with a person. </p>
<p>2) Be grateful and thank people: Everyday think of a list of things you are grateful for and tell a person. You may even write the things you are grateful for and start a list in a place that you see frequent in your home. Also, take a moment to thank a person for any of their kindness and generosity. </p>
<p>3) Realize your life purpose: Realize you are a gift to this world and you have unique abilities and traits which no one else like you has in the world. Think about your life purpose and this life as a gift. </p>
<p>4) Aspire to meaningful goals: We all leave this life someday and we all should realize no one is in this journey alone. Help those in need and become in touch with meaningful goals. </p>
<p>5) Empathize with others: Have profound conversations with others and also find ways to feel what others are feeling with a soft gaze and open ears.</p>
<p>6) Give yourself: Give yourself grace by not punishing one for wrongs or mistakes. Mistakes are a part of growing and it&#8217;s a natural process. Give yourself time to mediate and enjoy quiet time to connect with your inner voice. It takes time to learn how to quiet the noise so we can hear our true messages.</p>
