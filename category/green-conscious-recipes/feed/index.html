<p>Good morning to all of you coffee addicts. As a former coffee addict, I must say I feel better now and more energetic throughout the day than I did before. I used coffee and caffeine drinks as a crutch for not living a balanced lifestyle in the past. Yogi&#8217;s believe coffee is a negative prana food which means to &#8220;take away life energy&#8221;. I now mostly use caffeine as a weekend treat. I try to spot out new cafes and relax with husband while enjoying cappuccinos.</p>
<p><strong>Try my morning tips:</strong></p> 
<p>Waking up naturally (no alarm clock ) opt to instead use beautiful and positive music to notify you. Open all the windows to allow fresh air and natural light in. I make my bed right away and this energy of getting things done flows throughout the day. I drink a glass of tall water with fresh lemon and mint and followed by my brain booster smoothie while I make breakfast.  I take first a warm shower and then switch to cool water . I use scents that make me feel awake such as orange, citrus and peppermint.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brain Booster Smoothie:</strong></p>
<p>1 Banana, 1 cup of blueberries, 1 tablespoon of avocado, 1/2 cup coconut milk, 2 tablespoons walnuts, 1 pinch of bee pollen, 1 teaspoon of MCT oil, and enough water for your desired consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Shower Time:</strong></p>

<p>Invest in a nice shower head. I love wide and large shower heads which feels like rain droplets. Find only a few and well researched products to keep in the shower. Find scents for morning and night. I use peppermint soap in the morning and in the evening I use calming scents like lavender. Use fresh lush and soft towels, shower curtains made up of natural materials. While taking a shower imagine being in a lush forrest and the shower is cleansing your aura field with fresh rainfall. </p>
<p><strong>The Art of Breakfast:</strong> Eat like a king or queen in the morning within 1 hr of waking. Use all whole foods and learn how to stay away from packaged foods. Also, make breakfast exciting again by trying out new recipes and adding your favorite fruits. Allow more time in the morning to make breakfast an event. Play music, set the table nice and spend just a few extra minutes creating quality time with loved ones. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you have family or friends that live very close by with similar schedules you may do a mini breakfast potluck. Set a clear standard of the time frame and allow enough time. I recommend 30 -45 minutes and time needs to be respected. To do this involves going to bed at the same time or very close to the hour every night.</p>
<p><strong>Give it a try and have a good morning!</strong></p>

What is  Dosha? In Ayurvedic medicine each of the three energies believed to circulate in the body and govern physiological activity. The Doshas are often thought of as biological energies found throughout the body and mind. Some people think of Dosha types as a way to understand the mental and physical characteristics of people to be used as a blueprint.  One purpose of knowing the Dosha type is so that one could make wise decisions in governing their health so  they can not only thrive in life, but also prevent the onset of disease.

Knowing your Dosha type can help in building the proper skin care regime, utilizing the best food choices and even finding types of exercises for your body type. By taking time to study and integrate the findings into environmental factors which aid in effortless well being. It is important to note that the study of Ayurveda is a very in depth study which dives deeply into a science and an art. Knowing your Dosha type is a very small piece of the study, but not to mention a very important piece. In Ayurveda theres three main Dosha types: Vatta, Pitta and Kapha. 

Each Dosha type eludes certain qualities and it takes time to understand these qualities once the intellectual side of the nutrition science is met. The ability to point out the Dosha qualities may come from an instinctive stance such as:

People from the Vata group will showcase qualities reflecting air, people from the Pitta group reflect fire and water, and people from the Kapha group may reflect elements of water and earth. In knowing these types people can choose through certain food groups which may aid the balance of their Dosha. For an example, a person in the Pitta group which has a lot of fire may require cooling foods. 

The goal of learning about your Dosha type is also to utilize foods, movements and lifestyle regime which result in a balanced mind, body and spirit.
